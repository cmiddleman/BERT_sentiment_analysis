In no particular order:

Idea 1: Some kind of NLP project on twitch.tv chat for various streamers? In case you are boomer, twitch is a streaming platform where people stream (mostly) video games live and approximately the last two months of their streams - including both video and chat - are availble on twitch

Idea 2: predict a review's star rating based on its text for amazon.com or something.

Idea 3: train a model to detect where on my screen I am looking at using live web cam footage. To fire lasers and do A/B testing on websites by seeing where peoples eyes look when going on a website or whatever.

Not super tied to any though, hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
