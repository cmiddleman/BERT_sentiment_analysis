In no particular order:

Idea 1: Some kind of NLP project on twitch chat for various streamers? In case you are boomer, twitch is a streaming platform where people stream (mostly) video games live and approximately the last two months of their streams - including both video and chat - are availble on twitch

Idea 2: get twitch video of players with hand cam on for a single video game and see the differences across rank. Bonus: give recomendations for how someone can make their arm/hand/wrist/mouse movement be more in line with what pros do.

Idea 3: maybe something not related to video games you friggin child.
